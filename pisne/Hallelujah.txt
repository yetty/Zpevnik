Hallelujah [Leonard Cohen]

I've [C]heard there was a [Ami]secret chord
That [C]David played, and [Ami]pleased the Lord
But [F]you don't really [G]care for music, [C]do you?
It [C]goes like this
The [F]fourth, the [G]fifth
The [Ami]minor fall, the [F]major lift
The [G]baffled king [Emi]composing Halle[Ami]lujah

Halle[F]lujah, Halle[Ami]lujah
Halle[F]lujah, Halle[C]lu[G]jah[C]

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Baby I~have been here before
I~know this room, I've walked this floor
I~used to live alone before I~knew you.
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

There was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I~moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It’s not a cry you can hear at night
It’s not somebody who has seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah

You say I~took the name in vain
I~don't even know the name
But if I~did, well, really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

I~did my best, it wasn't much
I~couldn't feel, so I~tried to touch
I've told the truth, I~didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
