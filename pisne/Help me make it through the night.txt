Help me make it [Kris Kristofferson]

[C]Take the ribbon from your hair,
shake it, loose and le it [F]fall.
[Dmi]Layin' soft against my [G]skin
like the shadows on the [C]wall.

Come and lay down by my side,
till the early morning light,
all I'm taking is your time,
help me make it through the night.

[C]I don't care what's right or [F]wrong,
I~don't try to [C]understand,
let the devil take [D]tomorrow,
for tonight I~need a [G]friend.

Yesterday is dead and gone,
and tomorrow out of sight,
and it's sad to be alone,
help me make it through the night.
