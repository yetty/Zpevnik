Oh Freedom

[E]Oh Freedom [H]oh [E]Freedom~[A]~~~[H]
[E]oh Fre[C#mi]edom over [F#]me[H].

[G#]Before I'd be a [C#mi]slave
I'd be [A]buried in my [F#]grave
and go [E]home to my [H]Lord
and be [A]free[E].

No more weeping no more weeping
no more weeping over me.

No more crying no more crying
no more crying over me.

There'll be singing there'll be singing
there'll be singing over me.
