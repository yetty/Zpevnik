Oh, Sister (EN)

[G]Oh sister [Hmi]when I~come to [C]lie in your [G]arms
[G]You should not [Hmi]treat me [C]like a strang[G]er
[G]Our Father [Hmi]would not like the [C]way that you [G]act
[G]And you must [Hmi]realize the [C]danger[G].

Oh sister am I~not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth
To love and follow His direction?

[F]We grew up [C]together
From the [G]cradle to the grave
[F]We died and were [C]reborn
And then [G]mysteriously [D]saved.

Oh sister when I~come to knock on your door
Don't turn away you'll create sorrow
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow.
