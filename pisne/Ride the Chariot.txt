Ride the Chariot

I'm gonna ride in the chariot in the morning, Lord
I'm gonna ride in the chariot in the morning, Lord
I'm getting ready for the judgement day
My Lord, my Lord

Are you ready my brother/sister? Oh yes
Are you ready for the journey? Oh yes
Do you want to see your Jesus? Oh yes
I'm waiting for the chariot 'cause I'm ready to go

Ride, ride, Ride in the chariot to see my Lord
Ride, ride, Ride in the chariot to see my Lord

Ride the chariot in the morning, Lord
Ride the chariot in the morning, Lord
I'm gonna ride in the chariot to see my Lord
