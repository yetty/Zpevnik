Amazing Grace [John Newton]

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I~once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I~see.

'T was grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I~first believed!

Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares,
I~have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promis'd good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease;
I~shall possess, within the veil,
A~life of joy and peace.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who call'd me here below,
Will be forever mine.
